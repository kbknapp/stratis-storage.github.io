# New Features

## Initial Stable Stratis Release

Stratis is a Linux local storage management tool that aims to enable easy use of advanced storage features such as thin provisioning, snapshots, and pool-based management and monitoring.

After two years of development, Stratis 1.0 has stabilized its on-disk metadata format and command-line interface, and is ready for more widespread testing and evaluation by potential users. Stratis is implemented as a daemon – `stratisd` – as well as a command-line configuration tool called stratis, and works with Linux kernel versions 4.14 and up.

Packages will soon be available for Fedora. We also hope that other Linux distributions consider packaging Stratis 1.0 components (although this will require support for Rust 1.25+ and Python 3).

# Open Issues

## Rapid Growth of Used Storage in Pool May Cause Errors

Rapid increase in the data stored in the pool, such as creating tens of filesystems in a loop, may cause filesystem creation to fail intermittently. Writing large amounts to filesystems in parallel may also trigger this. ([issue 1152])

## D-Bus API not yet stable

The Stratis development team has not yet declared Stratis’ D-Bus API as stable. We recommend waiting until it is, to integrate Stratis support into other tools. In the meantime, the stratis command-line tool can be used to configure and monitor Stratis pools. ([issue 1237])

## dm-cache issue in 4.18.7+ kernels affects Stratis Cache Tier

An issue with dm-cache that affects Stratis cache tier creation was introduced into the 4.18.7 stable release. Users interested in using a cache tier should avoid this and later kernels in the 4.18 series. This issue will be fixed in 4.19. ([issue 1212])
